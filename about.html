          My goal is simple. This website will allow people to learn. I hope
          this inspires you to learn more about cybersecurity/technology overall
          and pursue it further. I hope to expand and create something big. This
          website is my first step toward that. I have earned all these
          certifications and I hope to pass on the knowledge to you. Please
          follow my youtube channel!

        <div class="text-primary text-center text-lg-center">
          Cybersecurity Club (From our school newspaper) The Cybersecurity
          Club’s president, senior Skylar Shi, gained interest in cybersecurity
          his sophomore year and then invented the club his junior year. Now, as
          a senior he hopes the club will go on until after he graduates.
          “Outside from the practical knowledge that people can take with them,
          I wanted to spread interest into cybersecurity which is often
          stereotyped as boring,” Shi said. “But, recently I have been trying to
          make my clubs lively and even people who aren’t into tech can still
          have a good time. So my simple goal is to have my interest rub off on
          other people.” Everyone that attends a meeting will be presented with
          an introduction to a subject regarding cyber security, a mini lesson
          on a specific topic, a practical activity and to finish off, a fun
          game of Kahoot about what the attendees learned. Those activities take
          place every other Friday, during lunch in room 510.
